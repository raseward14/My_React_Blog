## Description
A Full-Stack MERN blog site containing a nav bar at the top, taking you to an articles list. Each article lets the user upvote, and comment on the article. Each article page is persisted by our database, and houses several components, including its own comments, and a articles list of the remaining articles on the site. Click the article titles to navigate to other articles, upvote, and leave comments!

This site was built while working through the LinkedIn Learning tutorial, React: Creating and Hosting a Full-Stack Site, by Full-Stack Software Developer, Shaun Wassell.

The course covers building an app, line by line from the ground up, and covers many React topics. App components, React-Router links, and React Hooks are just a few used on the front end.

Express.js, and Node.js are used on the back end to set up our server. We utilize route parameters to CRUD JavaScript objects stored in a nonrelational database, Mongodb. Because we work with JavaScript Objects in the front end, a nonrelational database made pushing data, and retrieving them easier.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and hosted on Amazon Web Services.
